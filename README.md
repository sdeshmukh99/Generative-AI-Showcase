# AI Product Management Journey

Welcome to my repository where I document my journey in exploring and applying **AI** concepts to Product Management (PM). This collection of showcases presents my hands-on work with AI models, particularly focusing on **Generative AI** and its applications. Through these showcases, I’m navigating the intersection of AI and product development—learning, building, and understanding how to leverage AI to create innovative solutions.

## Introduction: Why AI in Product Management?

AI is rapidly becoming one of the most sought-after specializations within Product Management. In today’s competitive landscape, AI PMs are at the forefront of innovation, overseeing AI-driven products and features that impact millions of users. However, breaking into this field comes with its own set of challenges, particularly around understanding the key differences between traditional PM roles and AI PM roles.

Through this repository, I aim to not only showcase practical AI implementations but also share my journey of transitioning from traditional PM work to mastering the nuances of AI PM. This is part of my broader goal to navigate the evolving landscape of AI while building the skills necessary to become a well-rounded AI Product Manager.

## Showcases

Each folder contains a specific project where I’ve applied AI techniques, fine-tuned models, and explored real-world use cases. These projects focus on understanding the role of AI in modern product management, from ideation and model development to deployment.

### Showcase 01: Fine-Tuning GPT-2 on MedQuAD for Medical Question Answering
In this showcase, I explore fine-tuning the **GPT-2 model** for **medical question answering** using the MedQuAD dataset. The objective is to understand how generative models can be adapted for specific domains, like healthcare, to provide useful insights and answers to complex medical queries.

- **Key Steps**: Dataset preparation, model fine-tuning, evaluation
- **Tools Used**: GPT-2, Transformers, Python, Google Colab
- **Business Application**: Automating responses to medical queries, potentially reducing the workload of medical professionals and enhancing patient care.

### Future Showcases
I will continue to add more showcases as I delve deeper into different aspects of AI and PM. Here are some areas I plan to explore:
- **Recommendation Systems**: Building recommendation algorithms that personalize content delivery.
- **Conversational AI**: Exploring chatbots and virtual assistants that enhance user experience.
- **Generative AI in Marketing**: Investigating AI tools to optimize marketing campaigns through automated content generation.

## Why AI PM?

AI Product Management has evolved into a crucial sub-specialization within the PM landscape. It’s not just about building products but understanding **how AI can solve real-world problems** that couldn’t be tackled before. In this repository, I document my learning, implementation, and thoughts as I strive to transition into an AI PM role.

This work is part of my **end-to-end journey** to bridge the gap between traditional PM roles and AI-specific roles. Whether you're exploring this field yourself or just interested in how AI can revolutionize product management, I hope this repository provides valuable insights.

## About This Journey

While I don’t consider myself an AI expert yet, my curiosity and passion for AI have led me to explore these complex systems, and through each project, I continue to build my knowledge and capabilities. I believe that with the right mix of **strategic thinking**, **technical understanding**, and **hands-on experience**, anyone can transition into the AI PM space and create lasting impact.

## Future Plans

As I continue this journey, I aim to:
- **Expand my expertise in AI**: Specifically around generative models, recommendation engines, and AI ethics.
- **Collaborate with AI engineers** to understand the nuances of AI model development, deployment, and scaling.
- **Document my learning process**: Offering insights to other PMs and enthusiasts looking to transition into AI PM roles.

Stay tuned for more updates and projects as I navigate the exciting world of AI Product Management.
