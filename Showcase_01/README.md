# Showcase 01 - Fine-Tuning GPT-2 on MedQuAD

This code demonstrates the fine-tuning of GPT-2 for the **Medical Question Answering (MedQuAD)** dataset. The goal is to adapt GPT-2 to answer medical questions effectively.

## Key Steps:
1. Installing dependencies.
2. Preparing the dataset (MedQuAD).
3. Fine-tuning GPT-2 on the dataset.
4. Evaluating the model performance.

## Files:
- `Fine-Tuning GPT-2 on MedQuAD for Medical Question Answering.ipynb`: The main Colab notebook containing the fine-tuning code and workflow.

## Business Applications:
A fine-tuned model such as this can be used in healthcare to provide automated responses to medical queries, improving patient care and reducing the workload for medical professionals.
