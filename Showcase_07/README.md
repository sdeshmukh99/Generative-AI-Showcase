## Introduction

This project demonstrates how we use Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 to automatically generate SQL queries and Python code based on natural language inputs. The goal is to make it easy to interact with financial data—specifically stock prices of Nifty 50 companies—without manual coding.

By typing a simple question in plain English, the model can:

- Understand what data you're asking for.
- Generate the correct SQL query to fetch that data from a database.
- Provide meaningful insights by analyzing the data or creating visualizations using Python.

We use LangChain and OpenAI to automate this process, removing the need for manual data querying and analysis. The project shows how we can combine the power of LLMs and structured data querying to efficiently analyze financial datasets with minimal effort from the user.

## 1. Required Modules
We start by importing necessary modules and installing required dependencies. Since this project is designed to be run in Google Colab or a similar notebook environment, dependencies like OpenAI, LangChain, and SQLite need to be installed.

These dependencies allow us to use LangChain for generating SQL queries and OpenAI for invoking the LLM (like GPT-4).

## 2. Data Loading and Preprocessing
Here, we load Nifty 50 stock price data from a pickle file, which contains data for 50 companies. This data is stored in a dictionary where each company’s stock data is a separate DataFrame.

We explore the data, checking the number of rows and columns for each company to get an understanding of data coverage.

Visualization:
We plot the number of data rows available for each company. This chart shows the distribution of data points for each company in the Nifty 50, allowing us to visually assess data coverage.

## 3. SQLite Database Creation
Next, we create an SQLite database to store this financial data for querying purposes. This step is crucial because the LLM will dynamically generate SQL queries that interact with this database.

We then insert the stock price data into the database. At this point, our stock price data is available in an easily queryable format within the database.

## 4. SQL Query Generation Using LLM
This is the heart of the project, where LangChain and OpenAI’s LLM are used to dynamically generate SQL queries based on natural language inputs.

Example SQL Query Generation:
Using LangChain, we create a chain that takes natural language requests and generates SQL queries. The LLM interprets user input and transforms it into an SQL query to interact with the data. For example, if we ask for "records of Wipro," the system generates an SQL query and fetches relevant data from the database.

## 5. Python Code Generation Using LLM
In addition to generating SQL queries, the LLM can generate Python code for deeper data analysis and visualization. For example, after extracting the data, the LLM might generate Python code to plot trends.

The LangChain pipeline handles all the intermediate steps, from interpreting the query to generating both SQL and Python code. This is key for projects that require multiple layers of data analysis.

## 6. Generating Insights from Data
After querying and analyzing the data, the final step is generating insights. This includes summarizing the results or plotting trends from the stock data.

For example, if we extract stock prices for Wipro, we can generate code to visualize trends in the ‘Close’ prices over time, thus providing insights into stock performance.

## 7. Closing the Database Connection
At the end of the notebook, we close the database connection to avoid leaving any open connections. This is good practice to ensure the system resources are properly freed after the operations are completed.

## Conclusion
While LLMs like GPT-4 excel at understanding and generating natural language, they are not inherently designed to handle structured datasets such as databases. LLMs do not have direct access to the underlying structure of relational data, which is why they may struggle to execute complex queries or extract specific data points efficiently. This is where SQL comes into play, as it is purpose-built for querying and interacting with structured data in a precise and optimized manner.

In this project, we use LLMs to interpret natural language inputs and generate SQL queries that interact with the structured financial data, combining the strengths of both technologies. This approach allows us to automate the data retrieval and analysis process, making it easy to gain insights from structured datasets like stock prices with minimal manual coding.
